# The Ultimate Checklist for Launching a New Small Business Website

Launching a new website is exciting - until the last week before launch turns into a blur of missing content, broken links, slow pages, and that nagging feeling that you forgot something important.

For small business owners and e-commerce retailers, a website is not just a digital brochure. It is your storefront, your sales rep, your customer support desk, and often your first impression. If the site loads slowly, looks untrustworthy, or makes it hard to buy or book, you will feel it immediately in fewer leads and lower sales.

This checklist is designed to help you launch with confidence. It covers the practical items that matter most for real businesses across the USA and Canada - including accessibility, local SEO, privacy requirements, payments, shipping, and performance.

Use it as a pre-launch plan, a QA guide, and a post-launch monitoring list.

## 1) Foundations: Clarify the goal before you polish the pixels

Before you tweak colors or rewrite headlines, confirm your website’s primary job. Most small business sites fall into one of these buckets:

- **Lead generation** (calls, quote requests, bookings)
- **E-commerce** (online sales, subscriptions, local pickup)
- **Hybrid** (sell online + drive calls/appointments)
- **Credibility** (portfolio, case studies, investor/customer trust)

### Quick goal checklist
- Define your primary conversion: *call*, *form submission*, *booking*, or *purchase*
- Identify your top 1-3 customer segments (by location, industry, or need)
- Decide what success looks like in 30 days (example: 30 quote requests, 10 online orders/day)

**Practical example:**  
A Toronto-based HVAC company serving Ontario might prioritize “Call Now” and “Book Service” above everything else. A Shopify retailer shipping across the USA and Canada might prioritize product discovery, trust badges, and a frictionless checkout.

## 2) Branding and content: Make it clear, not clever

Your website content should answer three questions quickly:

1. What do you do?
2. Who is it for?
3. Why should I trust you?

### Must-have pages for most small businesses
- **Home** - clear value proposition, primary call-to-action (CTA), trust signals
- **Services or Products** - scannable details, pricing ranges if possible, FAQs
- **About** - credibility, story, team, certifications
- **Contact** - phone, email, hours, service area, form, map if relevant
- **Privacy Policy** - especially important for lead forms and analytics
- **Terms** (recommended) - especially for e-commerce or bookings

### Content checklist
- Headline states the outcome you deliver (not just your business type)
- Each page has one primary CTA (avoid 5 competing buttons)
- Add proof: reviews, testimonials, certifications, case studies, client logos
- Use real photos when possible (team, shop, work, products)
- Ensure spelling and grammar are clean (it affects trust more than people admit)

**Actionable tip:** Put your phone number in the header for service businesses. For e-commerce, put shipping and returns links in the header or footer and repeat them near the “Add to cart” area.

---

## 3) Design and UX: Make it easy for customers to take the next step

A good-looking website that is hard to use will underperform. Focus on clarity and speed of decision-making.

### UX checklist (small business friendly)
- Navigation has 5-7 main items max
- Primary CTA is consistent across the site (example: “Request a Quote”)
- Forms are short (name, email/phone, message - plus 1-2 qualifying questions)
- Buttons look like buttons (high contrast, clear labels)
- Key info is visible without hunting: pricing ranges, service areas, shipping, hours

### Mobile-first checks (non-negotiable)
More than half of traffic is typically mobile, especially for local services.

- Tap targets are large enough (no tiny links)
- Sticky header does not block content
- Popups are not intrusive (Google can penalize aggressive interstitials)
- Checkout and forms are easy on mobile

**Practical example:**  
If you run a landscaping company in New Jersey, many customers will search on their phone while commuting or during a break. If your “Request a Quote” form is 12 fields long, you will lose leads.

---

## 4) Technical essentials: Hosting, domain, SSL, and email

### Domain and DNS checklist
- Domain is registered under your business (not a freelancer’s account)
- DNS access is documented (who can change records, where it is managed)
- WWW and non-WWW versions redirect properly (one canonical version)

### SSL and security basics
- SSL is active (your site loads as `https://`)
- HTTP redirects to HTTPS automatically
- Admin passwords are strong and unique
- Two-factor authentication is enabled where possible (CMS, hosting, email)

### Business email setup
Using `you@yourcompany.com` builds trust.

- Set up professional email (Google Workspace or Microsoft 365)
- Add SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to reduce spam issues
- Confirm contact form emails are delivered (and not landing in junk)

---

## 5) SEO checklist: Launch with a strong foundation (local + national)

SEO is not a one-time task, but launch is the best moment to avoid common mistakes.

### On-page SEO essentials
- One **unique title tag** and **meta description** per page
- Use one **H1** per page (clear topic)
- Headings are structured (H2, H3) and scannable
- Images have descriptive alt text (helps accessibility and SEO)
- Internal links connect related pages (services to contact, product categories to best-sellers)

### Local SEO (USA + Canada)
If you serve specific cities or regions, local SEO is a major growth lever.

- Add your **NAP** consistently - Name, Address, Phone
- Create or update your **Google Business Profile**
- Add service area and hours
- Embed a map on the contact page if you have a physical location
- Create location-specific service pages only if they are genuinely useful (avoid thin “city pages”)

**Practical example:**  
A dentist in Mississauga should make sure the site clearly shows the clinic address, parking info, hours, and a click-to-call phone number - plus structured content about key services like cleanings, Invisalign, or emergency appointments.

### Technical SEO checks
- Generate and submit an XML sitemap
- Ensure `robots.txt` is not blocking important pages
- Set canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content issues
- 301 redirect any old URLs if redesigning an existing site

---

## 6) Analytics and tracking: Measure what matters from day one

If you do not track conversions, it is hard to know whether your marketing is working.

### What to install before launch
- Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
- Google Search Console
- Conversion tracking for key actions:
  - Form submissions
  - Phone clicks (especially mobile)
  - Purchases (with revenue)
  - Bookings

### Simple conversion event example (GA4 via gtag)
If you are using gtag and want to track a successful lead form submission, your developer can trigger an event like this after the form is confirmed:

```html
<script>
  window.gtag && gtag('event', 'generate_lead', {
    method: 'contact_form'
  });
</script>
```

**Actionable tip:** Track phone clicks using a `tel:` link and a click event. For local service businesses, phone calls are often the highest-intent lead.

---

## 7) Performance checklist: Speed is a sales tool

A slow website leaks revenue. Speed affects conversions, SEO, and how professional your brand feels.

### Core performance checks
- Compress images (use modern formats like WebP when possible)
- Avoid huge videos loading automatically on mobile
- Minimize heavy plugins and third-party scripts
- Use caching and a CDN if available
- Test with PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse

### Quick targets to aim for
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): ideally under 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): low (no jumping layouts)
- Interaction responsiveness: fast enough to feel immediate

**Practical example:**  
If you run an e-commerce store and your product pages take 6-8 seconds to load, customers will bounce - especially on mobile data connections in rural areas or while traveling.

---

## 8) Accessibility checklist: Better for customers, safer for your business

Accessibility is about making your website usable for everyone, including people using screen readers or keyboard navigation. It also reduces legal risk - especially in the USA where accessibility-related lawsuits are more common.

### Accessibility essentials
- Sufficient color contrast for text and buttons
- Keyboard navigation works (menus, forms, modals)
- Form fields have labels (not just placeholder text)
- Images have meaningful alt text (or empty alt for decorative images)
- Clear focus states (users can see where they are on the page)

**Actionable tip:** Run a quick audit using Lighthouse accessibility checks, then fix the obvious issues before launch.

---

## 9) E-commerce-specific checklist: Payments, shipping, taxes, and trust

If you sell online, your launch checklist needs extra steps.

### Checkout and payment setup
- Payment gateways are connected and tested (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- Test with real devices (iPhone, Android) and multiple browsers
- Confirm fraud prevention settings (but do not over-block legitimate customers)
- Ensure receipts and order confirmation emails are branded and clear

### Shipping and taxes (USA + Canada considerations)
- Shipping rates are correct for your regions
- Delivery estimates are realistic (avoid vague “ships soon”)
- Return policy is easy to find and understand
- Taxes are configured properly:
  - Canada: GST/HST/PST rules vary by province
  - USA: sales tax can vary by state and nexus rules

If you are unsure about tax setup, confirm with your accountant or tax advisor. Your website platform can calculate - but it still needs correct configuration.

### Trust builders that increase conversion
- Display secure checkout messaging
- Show reviews near products
- Add clear policies: shipping, returns, warranty
- Include contact options (email, phone, chat if you can support it)

---

## 10) Forms, spam, and deliverability: Protect your inbox

Contact forms and quote requests are often the lifeblood of service businesses - but spam can overwhelm you quickly.

### Form checklist
- Required fields are truly required (do not overdo it)
- Confirmation message is clear (“We will respond within 1 business day”)
- Autoresponder email is enabled (optional but helpful)
- Spam protection is in place (reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, or server-side filtering)
- Submissions are stored somewhere reliable (email + dashboard/CRM)

**Actionable tip:** If you rely on leads, route form submissions to at least two recipients or a shared inbox so nothing gets missed.

---

## 11) Legal and privacy checklist: Do not skip this

Even small business websites collect data through forms, analytics, and cookies.

### Practical privacy essentials
- Add a Privacy Policy that reflects what you collect (forms, analytics, remarketing)
- Add cookie consent if required for your tools and region
- If you email customers, comply with:
  - **CASL** in Canada (strict rules for commercial email)
  - **CAN-SPAM** in the USA (unsubscribe and sender transparency)

If you are doing remarketing (Meta ads, Google Ads), ensure your policy mentions it and your consent setup is appropriate.

---

## 12) Pre-launch QA: The final “does everything work?” sweep

### QA checklist (print this section)
- All links work (including footer links and social icons)
- No placeholder text or stock “Lorem ipsum”
- Forms submit correctly and send emails
- Phone and email links work on mobile
- Images are optimized and not blurry
- 404 page exists and helps users navigate back
- Favicon is set
- Site works in Chrome, Safari, Firefox (and mobile browsers)
- Backups are enabled
- Admin access is documented (who has logins, where they are stored)

### Redirects if replacing an old site
If you had an old website, do not lose your SEO and backlinks.

- Export old URLs
- Map old URLs to new URLs
- Set up 301 redirects
- Keep the same domain if possible

---

## 13) Launch day and the first 30 days: Monitor, improve, and iterate

Launch is not the finish line - it is the start of real-world feedback.

### Launch day checklist
- Remove “noindex” tags (common staging mistake)
- Confirm analytics is recording live traffic
- Submit sitemap in Google Search Console
- Make a test purchase/booking (if applicable)
- Announce launch:
  - Email list
  - Social media
  - Google Business Profile post

### First 30 days checklist
- Review traffic and conversions weekly
- Watch for:
  - High bounce pages
  - Slow pages
  - Broken links
  - Form drop-offs
- Add 2-4 helpful blog posts or FAQs based on real customer questions
- Improve one key landing page each week (headline, CTA, trust signals)

**Practical example:**  
If your “Contact” page gets traffic but few submissions, try reducing form fields, adding a service-area note, and placing testimonials near the form.

## Common launch mistakes we see (and how to avoid them)

- **Forgetting to remove “noindex”** from staging - your site won’t show in Google
- **No conversion tracking** - you cannot tell what marketing works
- **Overcomplicated navigation** - users get lost and leave
- **Too many plugins/scripts** - performance drops and bugs increase
- **No clear service area** - local customers do not know if you serve them
- **Weak trust signals** - no reviews, no policies, no proof
