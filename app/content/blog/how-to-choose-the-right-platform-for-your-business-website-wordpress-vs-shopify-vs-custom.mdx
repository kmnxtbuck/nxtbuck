# How To Choose the Right Platform for Your Business Website (WordPress vs Shopify vs Custom)

Choosing a website platform can feel like picking the foundation for your building - once you commit, changing later can be expensive. Many small business owners and e-commerce retailers across the USA and Canada come to us with the same pain points:

- “My current site is slow and I’m losing leads.”
- “I need to sell online, but I don’t want to get locked into the wrong platform.”
- “I’m not technical - I just need something I can update.”
- “My friend says WordPress is best. My cousin says Shopify. My developer says custom. Who’s right?”

The truth is: **WordPress, Shopify, and custom builds can all be the right choice** depending on your business model, product complexity, marketing plans, and budget. This guide breaks down how to decide with clear tradeoffs, real-world examples, and a simple decision framework.

## Quick summary: When each platform is usually the best fit

### WordPress is usually best when you need:
- A marketing-first website (SEO content, landing pages, lead gen)
- Flexibility in design and features
- A CMS your team can update without a developer (with the right setup)
- Optional e-commerce (via WooCommerce) but not your only focus

### Shopify is usually best when you need:
- A reliable e-commerce engine with strong checkout
- Fast setup and fewer technical decisions
- Built-in inventory, payments, tax/shipping support, and app ecosystem
- A store-first site where product sales are the main goal

### Custom is usually best when you need:
- Unique workflows or integrations (ERP, quoting tools, custom portals)
- Performance and UX beyond typical themes/templates
- Full control over code, scalability, and architecture
- A competitive advantage from a tailored web experience

---

## Step 1: Clarify your primary goal - leads, sales, or systems

Before comparing features, answer this question:

**What is your website’s job?**

### If your goal is lead generation (service businesses)
Examples:
- Home services (HVAC, roofing, plumbing)
- Clinics, wellness, dental, legal
- B2B consultants and agencies

You likely need:
- Fast pages
- Strong local SEO structure
- Conversion-focused landing pages
- Simple content updates
- Forms, call tracking, CRM integrations

**WordPress often wins here**, with custom development available as you grow.

### If your goal is online sales (e-commerce retailers)
Examples:
- DTC brands shipping across the USA/Canada
- Specialty retail (apparel, skincare, supplements, home goods)
- Subscription products

You likely need:
- Best-in-class checkout
- Inventory management
- Product variants and collections
- Shipping/tax rules (Canada GST/HST, US state tax considerations)
- Email + ads integrations

**Shopify often wins here**, especially if you want to move quickly and reduce maintenance.

### If your goal is operational efficiency (systems and automation)
Examples:
- Wholesale + retail hybrid with special pricing rules
- Custom quoting and approvals
- Dealer portals
- Multi-location service scheduling
- Complex integrations with back-office tools

**Custom builds often win here**, because you are building software, not just a website.

## WordPress: Pros, cons, and best use cases

WordPress powers a large portion of the web for a reason - it’s flexible, widely supported, and great for content and SEO.

### WordPress is a strong choice if you want flexibility and SEO
**Pros**
- Excellent for content marketing (blogs, service pages, location pages)
- Huge plugin ecosystem (forms, SEO tools, booking, memberships)
- Flexible design options (from templates to fully custom themes)
- Easy to find developers and support
- Can scale well with proper hosting and optimization

**Cons**
- Requires maintenance (updates, security, backups)
- Plugin overload can slow down the site if not managed
- Quality varies - many sites are built with bloated page builders
- E-commerce via WooCommerce can be more complex than Shopify

### WordPress example: Local service business in Ontario + US expansion
A Toronto-based home services company wants:
- Separate pages for each service area (Toronto, Mississauga, Vaughan)
- Lead forms, call tracking, Google reviews integration
- SEO blog content to rank in Ontario now and expand into US cities later

A well-built WordPress site is ideal because it supports:
- Scalable SEO architecture
- Fast landing pages
- Marketing team updates without touching code

### WordPress cost and timeline (typical ranges)
For small businesses, realistic ranges are:
- **Template-based WordPress**: lower cost, faster launch (2-4 weeks)
- **Custom WordPress build**: mid cost, stronger performance and UX (4-10 weeks)

Ongoing costs usually include hosting, maintenance, and occasional development.

---

## Shopify: Pros, cons, and best use cases

Shopify is an e-commerce platform first. It is designed to help you sell reliably, with fewer moving parts than a self-hosted system.

### Shopify is a strong choice if e-commerce is your core business
**Pros**
- Best-in-class checkout and payment flow
- Hosting, security, and updates are handled for you
- Great inventory management and product organization
- Strong app ecosystem (email, subscriptions, reviews, upsells)
- Works well for cross-border sales (USA and Canada) with the right setup

**Cons**
- Monthly fees add up (plan + apps)
- Some customizations require Shopify theme development
- Platform constraints - you work within Shopify’s rules
- Content-heavy SEO sites can be done, but WordPress often feels better for publishing

### Shopify example: Canadian brand shipping to the USA
A skin care brand in Canada wants:
- CAD and USD pricing
- US shipping zones and duties messaging
- Email marketing integrations
- Product bundles and subscriptions

Shopify can handle this cleanly with:
- Shopify Payments (where available) or approved gateways
- Shipping profiles and tax settings
- Subscription apps and bundle apps

### Shopify cost and timeline (typical ranges)
- **Theme setup + configuration**: fast launch (2-6 weeks)
- **Custom Shopify theme + optimized UX**: (6-12 weeks)

Ongoing costs include the Shopify plan, apps, and optional development support.

## Custom websites: Pros, cons, and best use cases

A custom build usually means a website built specifically for your business using a modern framework (often Next.js/React) with a CMS (like Sanity, Contentful, or a headless WordPress) - or sometimes a fully custom admin.

### Custom is a strong choice when you need performance and unique functionality
**Pros**
- Maximum performance potential (Core Web Vitals, speed, UX)
- Tailored features and workflows
- Clean, scalable codebase
- Easier to integrate complex systems properly
- Better long-term control for businesses with unique needs

**Cons**
- Higher upfront cost
- Requires a developer for many changes (unless paired with a friendly CMS)
- Planning matters - scope creep can increase budget and timeline
- Not always necessary for early-stage businesses

### Custom example: B2B distributor with quoting + dealer portal
A distributor needs:
- Logged-in dealer pricing
- Quote requests and approvals
- Integration to an inventory system
- A content marketing section for SEO

A custom build can combine:
- A fast marketing site
- A secure portal
- API integrations
- A CMS for content updates

### Custom cost and timeline (typical ranges)
- **Custom marketing site with CMS**: (8-14+ weeks)
- **Custom web app + integrations**: (12-24+ weeks)

Ongoing costs include hosting, monitoring, and development iterations.

---

## Step 2: Compare platforms by what actually impacts your business

### 1) Total cost - not just upfront
When comparing platforms, consider:
- Build cost (design + development)
- Monthly fees (Shopify plans, premium plugins, apps)
- Maintenance (WordPress updates, security, backups)
- Future changes (new pages, new features, integrations)

**Rule of thumb**
- Shopify: predictable monthly costs, lower maintenance burden
- WordPress: lower platform fees, higher maintenance responsibility
- Custom: higher build cost, best long-term fit for complex needs

### 2) Speed and performance
Speed affects SEO and conversions. A slow site can quietly drain revenue.

- Shopify can be fast, but themes and apps can add weight
- WordPress can be very fast, but page builders and plugin bloat often slow it down
- Custom can be the fastest when engineered well

### 3) SEO and content marketing
If ranking on Google is critical:
- WordPress is typically the most comfortable for publishing and optimizing content
- Shopify can rank well, but blogging and complex content structures can feel limited
- Custom can be excellent for SEO, but requires deliberate setup (metadata, sitemaps, redirects, schema)

### 4) Security and reliability
- Shopify is managed - fewer security worries for owners
- WordPress security is good when maintained, but neglected sites are common targets
- Custom depends on your implementation - it can be very secure, but it must be maintained professionally

### 5) Ease of updating
Ask: “Who will update the site weekly?”

- WordPress: great if set up with a clean editor experience
- Shopify: easy for products, collections, orders, and promos
- Custom: can be easy if paired with a CMS, but not always DIY by default

---

## Step 3: Use this decision checklist (practical and fast)

Choose **Shopify** if most of these are true:
- You sell products online and checkout performance matters most
- You want the platform to handle hosting, updates, and security
- You want to launch quickly with proven e-commerce features
- You are fine paying monthly fees for stability and apps

Choose **WordPress** if most of these are true:
- You are service-based and need leads more than online checkout
- SEO content and landing pages are your growth engine
- You want flexible page layouts and marketing tools
- You can commit to ongoing maintenance (or hire it out)

Choose **Custom** if most of these are true:
- Your website needs custom workflows or integrations
- You need top-tier performance and a unique UX
- You expect rapid iteration and scalability
- Your site is a revenue-driving product, not just a brochure

---

## Practical examples: What we recommend in common scenarios

### Scenario A: Local contractor (USA or Canada) - wants more calls
**Best fit:** WordPress (or custom marketing site if competition is intense)

Key pages to prioritize:
- Service pages (one per service)
- Location pages (one per city/region)
- Quote request form + click-to-call
- Reviews and trust signals

### Scenario B: Small e-commerce brand - wants to launch in 30-45 days
**Best fit:** Shopify

Must-haves:
- Clean theme setup
- Fast product pages
- Email capture + abandoned cart flows
- Shipping/tax configured for USA/Canada

### Scenario C: Established retailer - needs BOPIS, POS, and online growth
**Best fit:** Shopify (often) or custom hybrid if workflows are unique

Focus on:
- Inventory accuracy
- Store pickup rules
- Promotions and reporting

### Scenario D: B2B company - wants content marketing plus lead routing
**Best fit:** WordPress or custom

Add:
- CRM integration (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
- Lead qualification forms
- Downloadable assets (guides, spec sheets)

## A small technical note: “Custom” does not mean “hard to edit”

Many business owners hear “custom” and assume:
- “I’ll need a developer for everything.”

That is only true if the site is built without a proper CMS.

A modern custom build can still be easy to update by connecting a CMS for:
- Pages and sections
- Blog posts
- Case studies
- FAQs
- Team members and locations

Here’s a tiny example of what a custom site might do behind the scenes - generating SEO-friendly metadata for each page from CMS content:

```js
// Example: Next.js metadata from CMS content (simplified)
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const page = await getPageFromCMS(params.slug);

  return {
    title: page.seoTitle || page.title,
    description: page.seoDescription || page.excerpt,
    alternates: { canonical: page.canonicalUrl },
  };
}
```

You do not need to understand this code - the point is that custom sites can be built with the same editing convenience as traditional platforms, while staying fast and scalable.

---

## Common mistakes to avoid (we see these a lot)

- **Choosing based on what a friend used** instead of your business model
- **Overbuilding too early** (custom when Shopify or WordPress would do)
- **Underbuilding too long** (staying on a fragile setup while revenue grows)
- **Ignoring ongoing costs** (apps, plugins, maintenance, and fixes)
- **Letting design drive the decision** instead of conversion and operations
- **No plan for SEO migrations** if you are redesigning an existing site

If you are rebuilding, always plan:
- 301 redirects
- preserving high-performing pages
- analytics and conversion tracking
- updated sitemap and indexing checks

---

## The simplest way to decide

If you want a clean rule:

- **Service business - start with WordPress** (or custom marketing site if you are competing in a tough market)
- **E-commerce business - start with Shopify**
- **Complex workflows or unique competitive advantage - invest in custom**

If you are unsure, the right answer is often a **hybrid**:
- Shopify for checkout + a custom or WordPress front-end for content and SEO
- WordPress for marketing + Shopify “Buy” integration for a small product line
- Custom front-end + headless CMS for maximum speed and editing control
